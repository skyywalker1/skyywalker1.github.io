  <h2>Starting Small: Why Our Homestead Dream Begins with Beeswax Wraps</h2>
  <p><em>Posted on April 11, 2025 by Heartland Haven Farm</em></p>
  <p>
    Some people start their homesteading journey with chickens. Others dig a garden or build raised beds. Me? I started with beeswax.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you're dreaming of a self-sustaining farm, it can feel overwhelming. Land is expensive, animals take daily care, and there's always something that needs fixing. But I still wanted to begin <em>something</em> — something real I could hold in my hands and share with others.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I made my first batch of beeswax food wraps in my tiny kitchen. I melted the wax, mixed in pine resin and jojoba oil, and brushed it onto cotton fabric with a shaky hand and a hopeful heart. And honestly? They weren’t perfect. But they smelled amazing, worked beautifully, and felt like a small win in the middle of a big dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s the spirit of Heartland Haven. We’re building our farm one small step at a time — starting with handmade things, made with care. If you’re dreaming too, I just want to say: it’s okay to start where you are, with what you have. Even if it’s just a square of beeswax.
  </p>

    Thanks for being here. 💛
